# ProConnect
ProConnect is a platform for artists and creative professionals to share their work in progress, gather community feedback, and iterate based on user input.  Artists can upload various media formats (pictures, videos, audio) with size restrictions, while the community engages by voting on versions, providing text feedback in secure Matrix-powered group chats, and sparking discussions.
